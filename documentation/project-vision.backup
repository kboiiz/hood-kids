## *An app that extends our real world communities into a digital space. A place where we can map and connect our physical homes and also create meta homes that connect people in different ways*

### What is it?:
It's a platform that maps out physical homes of our community onto a map of the meta community. Think hand drawn map of pioneers times, where the lines aren't really accurate and there's a whole bunch of cool treasures and places to explore that may or may not actually exist physically in the world. It allows people to represent their home in new and interesting ways, that maybe they wouldn't be able to do otherwise. These representations can be fun and exciting artistic expressions of a persons home, and further, they are useful expressions that can act as places to communicate with the community, or ways to extend digital invites to real world events, or simply a way to update the community with happenings at home.

### What's the point of all this?
Glad you asked. Here's a few ideas on how it may evolve:
+ Users can get create "spirit homes" on the platform that extend what their real home is. This allows users to create anything they want and call it their hope. The cool part here is that people can get excited about their spirit home in a way that maybe isn't financially / physically possible in the physical world. And maybe this helps people to inspire themselves to think about their home differently and start to build a home that more like what they want!

+ The map could be a space that extends the physical space of friends. It's a place where people can share ideas, values, art, and events. Maybe this space becomes full of ideas and eventually snowballs into a community that is more strongly aligned and inspired by each other. One person shares how they grew sweet potatoes in their green house, and then more than a couple other people are excited to try it too. We love sweet potatoes and never knew we could grow them here! Maybe there's other things we could grow together too?!
+ Eventually, the space could and probably should exist on web3 platforms. Everything is tokenized and owned by the people that create them. maybe this exists on some l2 platform like Optimism or Polygon?
+ Hopefully the space helps people to connect better in the real world too. ie, if someone in the neighborhood needs help with a project, or is trying to sell something, or maybe they just want to open their doors on a sunday morning for a neighborhood brunch! The space would have a feed of some sort that show events happening at different homes. 
+ People could share just about anything happening at their home. Maybe it's also a place to share knowledge and educate each other. Lots of people we know are wicked smart and sometimes we don't even know what cool things our friends know. Or maybe it's not a physical world building but it's a digital gallery for art and music. Maybe sometimes it's just a soapbox...And then maybe sometimes it's just a place to let others know that you're having a party

### Pieces of the project:
+ #### The map:
  + A map with hand drawn appearance. It is a "fuzzy" representation of the real world, and it allows users to add any home/place/treasure that they want on the map.
+ #### The home
  + ...or "spirit" home? "meta" sounds so lame nowadays. But this is where users can create whatever they want, and this is where a lot of the social incentives come in. IE, people would want to make their home dope af, just like how people in the real world want to impress others with their home. But really that's just one little hook to get people to use the app.
+ #### The feed 
  + A feed for users to get notifications of events and things going on.
